Project Overview
When smart phones become a media center rather than just a phone, apps is also flouring with more functions. This project is to build an Android mobile application called Power Tools, which can implement some basic functions, such as flashlight, SOS signal, clock, alarm, timer, daily news, and air quality report. 

The Purpose of the Project
Power Tools combines four common features - Flashlight, Clock, Daily News, and PM 2.5 into one application. Power Tools has a brief user interface, and the operation is quite easy. 

1. Flashlight
Most of the smart phones are embedded a flashlight for the camera function, which is what we can use for electric torch. When we are trapped into dark area without any emergency solutions to connect to the outside, our app is eligible to send “SOS” message by flashing the back flashing light with the lightest brightness. We also add the function of police alarm for warning functions.
It is more common when you are going to find something at night. A constant bright light helps a lot. Just open power tools and click the torch on the screen, the phone immediately transformed into a bright flashlight. It is also applicable to use the screen as a torch when you do not need such a bright light.

2. Clock
Clock contains four features – time, alarm, timer, and stop. Time is used to display current time as analog and as digital. Alarm is used to set alarms. Users can set as many alarms as they wish. In Timer, users can set an original time, then the timer will count down to 00:00 and warn users. The function of Stop is like a stopwatch.  

3. Daily News
Daily News pushes latest news to devices. It displays the title and abstract of the news. When users select the news, the page will turns into original website. 

4. Environment Monitoring 
Inhalable particle is a hot headline in Western Asia including China, Korean and Japan. Environmental problems are gaining more attention. At the beginning of 2015, in Paris, the index of the inhalable particle (PM 2.5) reached the highest point. 
People in China are more accustomed to check the PM 2.5 before go out everyday. We implement the Environment monitor to assist people decide whether wearing a mask.
